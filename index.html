  <h1>Sarah Andyshak's Portfolio</h1>
  <img src="img/Pusheen.png" alt="An image of me with a giant stuffed cat.">
  <p>This is my first truly solo webpage, and it will need a lot of work as the class goes on! I enjoy creating, and I look forward to becoming more comfortable with coding as the course progresses.</p>
  </ul>
  <h1>Links to My Projects</h1>
  <p>Here are some of the projects that I have worked on at Epicodus:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Hello World!</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The first sample website to begin learning to code. It simply says "hello!" in several language, and was created using directions from Epicodus.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Goodbye</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A follow-up to "Hello World!" this page says "goodbye" several times, and was created with my classmate Owen.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>My First Webpage</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I worked on this page with my classmate Asia. The project has several pages about favorite places and things.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Branching website</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Asia and I created this website following Epicodus's lesson on creating and merging branches.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Michael's Favorite Things</li>
        <ul>
          <li>My classmate Eliot created this webpage, which describes Epicodus founder Michael's favorite things, with another classmate following directions from Epicodus's lessons, and then we used it to practice CSS styling.</li>
          </ul>
      <li>Resort</li>
      <ul>
        <li>This project has several pages with information about an imagined resort. I created the project when working with Asia, and Eliot and I used the "pictures" page to practice CSS styling.</li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
