      <ul>
        <li>A two-part project: <em>Parks Directory</em> is an API with information on national and state parks, monuments, and forests. <em>Parks Explorer</em> is the associated MVC site.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>An MVC site created to help neighbors share resources and propose events. Created during the second team week, with classmates! We also created the <a href ="https://github.com/SarahAndyshak/HiddenGardenApi.Solution">API consumed by this site, found here.</a></li>
      </ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/SarahAndyshak/PierresTreats.Solution">Pierre's Bakery</a></li>

        <li>An app for bakery patrons to view pastries, and for the owner to update the site. Created using C#.</li>

The site styles the website with a custom color palette based on their chosen color and the ColorMind API, and returns clothing suggestions based on their input from the gear form.

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I've always been involved in the arts. I often work in watercolor, and most recently, digitally using Procreate on an iPad. I double-majored in studio art and Russian language in college, have sold commissioned art, and in December 2022, I had my first booth at an art fair. I have taught several subjects to students from kindergarten to university level. I taught K-12 art, middle school English and Social Studies, and high school World History at an international school in Prague. After that I went to graduate school and earned a PhD in art history, and taught as an art history professor for seven years. I decided to take a class on programming because I wanted to be able to live closer to my family. Several people suggested looking into programming because of its creative aspects.</p>
