  <h2>Links to My Projects</h2>
  <p>Here are some of the projects that I have worked on at Epicodus:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/SarahAndyshak/hello-world">Hello World!</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>The first sample website to begin learning to code. It simply says <em>"hello!"</em> in several languages, and was created in html using directions from Epicodus.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/SarahAndyshak/goodbye">Goodbye</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>A follow-up to "Hello World!" this page says <em>"goodbye"</em> several times, and was created in html using VS Code with my classmate Owen.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/SarahAndyshak/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>I worked on this page, written in html on VS Code, with my classmate Asia. The project has several pages about favorite places and things.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/SarahAndyshak/branching-website">Branching website</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Asia and I created this website, written in html, following Epicodus's lesson on creating and merging branches. We experimented with inline text and CSS styles to learn these techniques.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/SarahAndyshak/favorite-things">Michael's Favorite Things</a></li>
        <ul>
          <li>My classmate Eliot created this webpage, which describes Epicodus founder Michael's favorite things, with another classmate following directions from Epicodus's lessons. It is written in html, and then we used it to practice CSS styling.</li>
          </ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/SarahAndyshak/resort">Resort</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>This project has several pages with information about an imagined resort. I created the project, written in html using VS Code when working with Asia, and Eliot and I used the <a href="https://github.com/SarahAndyshak/resort/blob/main/pictures.html">"pictures"</a> page to practice CSS styling.</li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I've always been involved in the arts. I often work in watercolor, and most recently, digitally using Procreate on an iPad. I double-majored in studio art and Russian language in college, have sold commissioned art, and in December 2022, I had my first booth at an art fair. I have taught several subjects to students from kindergarten to university level. I taught K-12 art, middle school English and Social Studies, and high school World History at an international school in Prague. After that I went to graduate school and earned a PhD in art history, and taught as an art history professor for seven years. I decided to take a class on programming because I wanted to be able to live closer to my family. Several people suggested looking into programming because of its creative aspects.</p>
